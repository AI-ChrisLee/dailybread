## The Sharp Positioning

### What We Are:

"Biblical answers to the founder problems churches ignore"

Churches talk about patience and faith. We talk about:

- Firing your co-founder
- Pivoting when investors disagree
- Scaling without losing your soul
- Competing against funded giants
- Managing burnout while bootstrapping

## The 30-Day MVP Frameworkâ„¢

### Structure: Daily Challenges, Daily Solutions

- **30 Days = 30 Core Founder Challenges**
- **1 Challenge/Day = 1 Biblical Solution per Day**
- **Total:** 30 lessons for MVP launch

### Content Categories:

- **Days 1-10:** STARTUP FOUNDATIONS (co-founders, funding, early scaling)
- **Days 11-20:** GROWTH CHALLENGES (hiring, pivots, competition)
- **Days 21-30:** CRISIS & MATURITY (burnout, exits, succession)

## Sharpened Value Proposition

### The Audible Model:

- **Not:** "Netflix for biblical business"
- **But:** "Audible for founder wisdom"

Features:

- Library of targeted lessons
- Download for offline
- Continue where you left off
- Speed controls for busy days
- Topic-based navigation

## Updated Marketing Messages

### Level 4 Messaging (Without Bible Language):

- **Instead of:** "Be like David facing Goliath"
- **Say:** "Stop fighting giants on their terms. Here's the underdog playbook that actually works."
- **Instead of:** "Solomon's wisdom for business"
- **Say:** "The scaling system that built a trillion-dollar empire (and why it failed)."
- **Instead of:** "Moses' leadership journey"
- **Say:** "From solo founder to CEO of 2 million - the painful transition no one talks about."

## Simplified North Star Metric

### Primary Metric: Daily Active Lessons (DAL)

- Easy to track
- Shows real engagement
- Correlates with value
- **Target:** 1 lesson/day/user for 30 days

### Supporting Metrics:

- Completion rate (>80%)
- Topic relevance (which days get most plays)
- Problem-solution match rate
- 30-day completion rate

## The Sharpened Story Arc

### Your Founder Story:

1. Built agency to $600K (founder credibility)
2. Hit the scale ceiling (felt the pain)
3. Searched for wisdom (churches didn't help)
4. Found patterns in scripture (the breakthrough)
5. Tested with founders (proof it works)
6. Building DailyBread (scaling the solution)

### The Hook:

"I built a $600K agency and almost burned out. Churches told me to pray more. But I found Solomon had already solved my exact problem 3,000 years ago. That's when I realized: every biblical leader was a founder first."

ðŸ“± Audible for startup wisdom

### Landing Page Headline:

"Your Church Can't Help You Fire Your Co-founder"
But biblical founders faced the same problem. Here's what they did.

### The Promise:

Whatever challenge you're facing today, biblical founders faced it first. We'll show you exactly how they solved it.

## The Bottom Line

- **Positioning:** Biblical answers to founder problems churches ignore
- **Price:** $49/month
- **Metric:** Daily Active Lessons (1/day)
